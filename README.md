✅ What You've Completed

🚀 Application
Built a Node.js app with Express
Configured it to run inside a Docker container

🐳 Docker
Wrote a Dockerfile
Built and tested images locally
Published image to Docker Hub

🔁 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Automated Docker builds on every push
Ran containerized health checks (curl)
Pushed to Docker Hub using secure secrets

☁️ Deployment
Pulled the image from Docker Hub on another system: docker pull your-dockerhub-username/docker-ci-image:latest
Ran the container successfully with correct port mapping: docker run -p 3003:3003 your-dockerhub-username/docker-ci-image

------------------------------------------

📦 Build the Docker image on every push
✔️ You set up a GitHub Actions workflow triggered by push to the main branch, and it builds the Docker image using docker build.

🧪 Run simple containerized tests
✔️ Your workflow runs a container from the image, waits for it to start, and uses curl to test that it's responding (curl --fail http://localhost:PORT).

🐳 Push the image to Docker Hub on successful tests
✔️ You used the docker push step after the test passes, so only successful builds are published.

🔐 Make sure secrets (like Docker Hub credentials) are securely stored and used
✔️ You stored your Docker Hub username and access token in GitHub Secrets and referenced them like this:

username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

🚀 Trigger the workflow from a test repo and observe logs

Pushed code from your test repo
Observed workflow runs in the Actions tab
Saw full logs, including Docker build, run, test, and push output

✅ Final Verdict:
Yes, you have successfully completed every part of the task.
You’ve built a working CI/CD pipeline with Docker, GitHub Actions, and Docker Hub — a real-world DevOps workflow.
