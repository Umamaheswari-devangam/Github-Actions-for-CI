📦 Build the Docker image on every push
✔️ You set up a GitHub Actions workflow triggered by push to the main branch, and it builds the Docker image using docker build.

🧪 Run simple containerized tests
✔️ Your workflow runs a container from the image, waits for it to start, and uses curl to test that it's responding (curl --fail http://localhost:PORT).

🐳 Push the image to Docker Hub on successful tests
✔️ You used the docker push step after the test passes, so only successful builds are published.

🔐 Make sure secrets (like Docker Hub credentials) are securely stored and used
✔️ You stored your Docker Hub username and access token in GitHub Secrets and referenced them like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
🚀 Trigger the workflow from a test repo and observe logs
✔️ You:

Pushed code from your test repo

Observed workflow runs in the Actions tab

Saw full logs, including Docker build, run, test, and push output

✅ Final Verdict:
Yes, you have successfully completed every part of the task.
You’ve built a working CI/CD pipeline with Docker, GitHub Actions, and Docker Hub — a real-world DevOps workflow.
